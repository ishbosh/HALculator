# HALculator
A basic calculator to complete project assignment by The Odin Project.
Divide by zero, if you dare.

The goal of this project is to use what I have learned about HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript to create an on screen calculator. The main functions of
the project will be to Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide numbers input
via buttons on the calculator and display the input and the results. It
will also have a "clear" button and should calculate in the order the
values are entered (NOT using standard order of operations). As an
example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 will be equal to 42 since it will be calculated
in the order each operation is entered.

Secondary / bonus project objectives: Allow decimals, add a backspace,
improve the visual aspect, add keyboard support, add operations such as
factorial, exponentiation, square root / nth root.
